1) In redux we store our application state inside a single javascript object called store
2) This object is truth / source of all application of state and it is acessible to all parts of the ui
3) Redux built  on top of functional programming 
4) So store is a immutable object we cant update directly
5) To update it we create a function which stores the store as a argument and return updated store, so in this fun use spread or immutable object library, this function is called reducer
6) reducer takes the current instance of store and returns the updated store
7) how dooes the reducer know that what it should update inside the store ?
8) So we need another building block called an action 
9) action is just a plain js text that describes what just happened in reducer function
10) give reducer action as a second parameter
11) Based on the action the reducer will update the store and return it
12) Building blocks in redux: action (event), store, reducers (event handlers)
13) Whenever to create a redux follow the following steps:
   a) design the store
   b) define the actions
   c) create a reducers
   d) setup the store on updating
